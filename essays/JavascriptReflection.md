## Why Javascript?
The ICS program at UH Manoa is set up pretty interestingly. Students start at ICS 111, learning the basics of programming using Java. This is continued in ICS 211 as many of the basic ADTs and sorting algorithms are taught using Java. Once students reach 212, they go back to the beginning and learn some of the same concepts, but now in C, with a bit of C++ thrown in at the end of the semester. Java, C, and C++ are all pretty similar in how they operate. With the exception of pointers in C and C++, one can go from learning Java to learning C pretty easily as they only have somewhat minor syntax differences. This is where Javascript comes in at ICS 314.

## What's Wrong?
As you may have guessed, Javascript, so far, is the outlier in all of this. It is quite an odd language that seemse to take much of what was learned with previous languages and just chucks it out the window. Just from going through the basic Javascript tutorials, one might be quite confused as to how this language functions as it seems to be the simplest of the languages mentioned earlier. How is it that all variables can be defined with the same keyword? Where is the main function? Why do objects look like that? Why does '0' == 0 return true?! 

It is just the beginning of learning Javascript, so the true colors of the language will surely surface in the near future. However, the language is definitely a big change and seems to flip everything that has been taught on its head. While it is a confusing language at the moment, it may become a personal favorite as the semester continues.
