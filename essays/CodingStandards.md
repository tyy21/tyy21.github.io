## Why I (sometimes) Enjoy Standards
Coding standards often receive extremely mixed reviews. Many who are beginning to learn coding absolutely hate having to conform to a very specific set of rules regarding things like spacing and rules. I, on the other hand, almost always enjoyed having coding standards. While they can be frustrating to deal with, they do help to clean up code and especially help new coders to not make spaghetti code. Code that follows rules will look nicer and will be much easier to read and follow in comparison to code that doesn't. When working with an IDE that can import rules, often coding standards are an afterthought as everything is done for the programmer, but my dislike for standards comes when working in a text editor. Having to format code in VIM is a nightmare, even with all of the shortcuts. UH Manoa's ICS 212 course imposed a strict set of coding standards that required exactly 4 spaces as an indent, all braces to have their own line, and many other things. This made me absolutely hate working in text editors and realize how helpful a good IDE is.

## Standards As A Learning Tool
While standards definitely help readers (and the programmer) to understand code, they are also a very useful learning tool. Imposing a set of rules on yourself, especially in regards to how the code actually functions and what types of things are allowed can force creativity out of the programmer. For example, one of the rules for the ICS 212 standards was that only one return statement was allowed per function.
