The ICS 111 class at UH Manoa requires all students to create a game for a final project using Java and the EZLibrary. This project could be done either as an individual or as part of a team. My team and I decided to create an arcade-style shooter game in which the goal is to destroy oncoming UFO attackers for points. The game runs infinitly until the player gets hit by a UFO. The player is only allowed to move left and right and shoot upwards. What makes the game quite difficult is that while keeping track of the approaching enemies, the player must also keep track of their ammo, which can be refilled by touching boxes that appear on either end of the screen.

The project had a list of requirements, forcing students to include certain aspects in their games. This list included things like 2D arrays, object oriented programming, and inheritance, giving a great overview of Java's many traits and what Java is capable of. The project was completed over the course of about a month and required strong time management skills, as well as good communication and teamwork. This project was a great learning experience, getting me to try my hand at game development and providing a good environment for learning the basics of Java.
